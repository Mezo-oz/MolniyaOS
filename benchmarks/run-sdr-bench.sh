# MolniyaOS — Test 2: dropped SDR samples (rtl_test sweep)
# ============================================================================
# Run this ON THE PI, once per boot configuration. REQUIRES the RTL-SDR dongle.
#
# Test 1 measures scheduling latency, which is the mechanism. This measures the
# consequence: how many samples the USB capture path actually loses, at the rates
# a real capture uses. It is the number that matters to a decoded image, and the
# one a reader will care about more than microseconds of wakeup latency.
#
# METHOD:
#   rtl_test -s <rate> streams from the dongle and reports every gap it sees as
#   "lost at least N bytes". It has no duration flag, so each run is bounded by
#   timeout(1) sending SIGINT, which rtl_test handles by cancelling the async
#   read and exiting cleanly. Lost bytes are summed per run.
#
#   Samples, not bytes, are the reportable figure: the dongle delivers 8-bit I
#   and 8-bit Q, so one complex sample is two bytes.
#
# CONFIGURATIONS: the same A/B/C matrix as Test 1, detected the same way. Report
# B-A as the PREEMPT_RT result and C-B as the isolation result, never C-A.
#
# GOVERNOR: set to performance before every run and restored on exit, for the
# same reason as Test 1 — ondemand ramp latency would otherwise be folded into
# whichever kernel happened to be measured cold.
#
# SMOKE-TESTED 2026-09-07, config C, --quick into /tmp/sdr-smoke. Both rows
# completed and the rtl_test parsing is VALIDATED -- but not by that run. Two
# clean 30 s rows at 2.4 MS/s reported zero loss, and `grep -c "lost at least"`
# on both raws returned 0, meaning sum_lost_bytes' awk branch had never executed:
# a file with no matching line and a file whose wording the pattern misses are
# the same output. It was validated by forcing loss at 3.2 MS/s --
#   timeout --signal=INT 30 rtl_test -s 3200000 > parsecheck.txt 2>&1 || true
# -- which produced one gap line and summed to 188 bytes = 94 samples. A clean
# row is only evidence if something in the same session produced a dirty one.
# The full DURATION=600 sweep has still never been run.
#
# Smoke-test with --quick AND a scratch directory, never the real results dir:
#   MOLNIYA_BENCH_OUT=/tmp/sdr-smoke ./run-sdr-bench.sh --quick
# Raw files overwrite while sdr-summary.tsv appends, so a --quick pass into the
# real directory destroys the raw evidence for 2.4 MS/s and leaves rows that
# outlive it. The `seconds` column is what tells a 30 s row from a 600 s one.
#
# SHARED CODE: governor control, config detection and thermal state are executable
# helpers, called as subprocesses and never sourced — the shape the extraction rule
# in ROADMAP.md settled on when thermal gating tripped the 400-line trigger in
# run-latency-bench.sh. This file held the last inline copies; it no longer does.

# Sample rates to sweep, in samples/second. 2.4 MS/s is the usual NOAA APT rate;
# 3.2 MS/s is above what the USB path reliably sustains on most dongles, and is
# included precisely because that is where the kernels should diverge most.
RATES=(1024000 2048000 2400000 3200000)

# Seconds per run. Ten minutes per rate per load per configuration is a long
# afternoon; that is the point — sample loss is bursty and a 30-second run tells
# you almost nothing.
DURATION=600

# Thermal gate. It matters more for Test 2 than for Test 1, not less: the sweep
# runs `stress-ng --cpu 4 --io 2` for ten minutes per rate — the load that took a
# stock Pi 5 to its soft limit with the fan already at 4/4, and every cpu-load row
# in Test 1 throttled. A throttle drops the clock, which is exactly what makes the
# USB path miss its service deadlines, so here it inflates the published number.
#
# The sharper reason is the sweep's own shape: RATES ascends, and ungated so does
# accumulated heat, so the highest rate is always measured hottest. "Loss rises
# with rate" is both the headline result and what thermal drift alone would
# produce. Starting every run from one temperature is what separates them.

# --- Result parsing ---------------------------------------------------------

# rtl_test publishes its OWN aggregate -- "Samples per million lost (minimum): N"
# -- and that is the reportable figure. It is normalised, so it is comparable
# across rates and durations in a way an absolute byte count is not.
#
# WHY THE BYTE COUNT IS NOT THE METRIC, established 2026-09-07 by a positive
# control (rtl_test at 3.2 MS/s, nice -n 19, under stress-ng --cpu 16 --io 8):
# rtl_test does not print gaps as they happen. It DEFERS every "lost at least N
# bytes" line until the async read is cancelled, so in a 51-line capture the
# cancel marker sat at line 20, the ppm summary at 21, and all 30 gap lines at
# 22-51. Position therefore carries no information about when a gap occurred,
# and no filter on it can separate loss during the run from the final flush.
#
# An earlier revision of this file tried exactly that, keying on the cancel
# marker. It was wrong twice over: it zeroed the column completely (every gap is
# post-cancel, always), and the reasoning behind it -- that config C's 188 bytes
# at 3.2 MS/s was purely a teardown artifact -- was half wrong. Those bytes were
# a real deferred gap report. They read as 0 ppm because 94 samples out of
# 1.92e9 is 0.05 ppm, which rounds to nothing. The conclusion held; the reason
# did not. Do not reintroduce a position-based filter.
#
# So: ppm is the metric. Bytes are advisory, a LOWER BOUND that includes the
# final flush -- "lost at least" and "(minimum)" are both rtl_test hedging, and
# the two accountings do not reconcile exactly.

# Samples per million lost, per rtl_test's own summary. Prints "unknown" when the
# line is absent rather than 0: a missing metric and a measured zero are different
# facts and only one of them is a result. That distinction is the whole reason
# this function exists -- see the smoke test, where two zeros meant "never parsed".
lost_ppm() {
    awk '
        /Samples per million lost/ {
            for (i = NF; i >= 1; i--)
                if ($i ~ /^[0-9]+$/) { v = $i; found = 1; break }
        }
        END { print (found ? v : "unknown") }
    ' "$1"

# cell in a results table is ambiguous in a way that zero is not.
