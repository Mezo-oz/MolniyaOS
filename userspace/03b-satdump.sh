# MolniyaOS 03b — SatDump
# ============================================================================
# Run this ON THE PI. Builds SatDump from source at a pinned release.
#
# SatDump is the centrepiece of the SATCOM focus: it takes a capture from
# antenna to finished image in one pipeline, and it covers the formats this
# project cares about — NOAA APT and HRPT, Meteor-M LRPT, MetOp, GOES HRIT and
# EMWIN, FengYun. Nothing else in the SDR ecosystem replaces it.
#
# EXIT CODES: 0 built and installed, 3 declined by the user.
#
# TIME: a substantial C++ build. Budget an hour on four Cortex-A76 cores and do
# not run it over a flaky SSH session — use tmux or screen.
#
# RUN ON HARDWARE: in the image-build chroot 2026-08-23, and on pi-server's live
# system 2026-09-13 (about 26 minutes for this job). Written from upstream's own
# Debian instructions at the pinned commit.

# === PINNED VERSION =========================================================
# SatDump 1.2.2, the latest tagged release (2024-11-29), read from upstream
# 2026-07-29. Master is far newer, and upstream's "nightly" tag moves — which is
# exactly why it is not what gets pinned. See 02c-sdr-userspace.sh for the full
# rationale on pinning commits rather than tags or tarball checksums.
