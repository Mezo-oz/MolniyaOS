# MolniyaOS 03 — SATCOM Stack (Phase 1a/1c) — sequencer
# ============================================================================
# Run this ON THE PI, from a clone of this repository. Unlike the 02 set, these
# scripts are NOT packaged into the kernel tarball: they are not part of getting
# the kernel running, and bundling a Phase-1 userspace build into the kernel
# payload would muddle what that tarball is for. On the Pi:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/Mezo-oz/MolniyaOS
#   ./MolniyaOS/userspace/03-satcom-stack.sh
#
# It sequences three jobs, each with its own prompt and each runnable alone:
#
#   03a-gnuradio-stack.sh   GNU Radio + gr-osmosdr + SoapySDR   (apt, pinned)
#   03b-satdump.sh          SatDump                             (source, pinned)
#   03c-sdrpp.sh            SDR++                               (source, pinned)
#
# Declining one does not stop the others — they are independent, and each is a
# long build you may well want to run on separate evenings. A job that exits 3
# means "the user said no"; anything else non-zero is a real failure and stops
# the run, because a half-built stack is worth knowing about immediately.
#
# PREREQUISITE: 02c-sdr-userspace.sh must have run first. It installs the
# RTL-SDR Blog fork of librtlsdr into /usr/local, which is what makes an RTL-SDR
# Blog v4 dongle work. 03b and 03c check for it and refuse to build without it,
# rather than producing binaries that cannot see the hardware.
#
# TIME: SatDump and SDR++ are both substantial C++ builds. The first live run on
# pi-server (2026-09-13, four Cortex-A76 cores, -j4) took 40 minutes for all
# three jobs; ROADMAP step 11 records what it found.
# ============================================================================
