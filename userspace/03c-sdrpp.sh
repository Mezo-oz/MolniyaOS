# MolniyaOS 03c — SDR++
# ============================================================================
# Run this ON THE PI. Builds SDR++ from source at a pinned commit.
#
# SDR++ is the interactive receiver: waterfall, multi-VFO, plugin architecture.
# It is the tool you reach for to find out what is actually on a band before
# pointing a decoder at it — live capture with a visible spectrum, rather than a
# pipeline you have to configure blind.
#
# EXIT CODES: 0 built and installed, 3 declined by the user.
#
# RUN ON HARDWARE: in the image-build chroot 2026-08-23, and on pi-server's live
# system 2026-09-13. Written from upstream's build instructions at the pinned
# commit. No CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is passed, so this installs under /usr rather
# than /usr/local — see ROADMAP step 11.
#
# HEADLESS NOTE: SDR++ is a GUI application and needs a display to run. It still
# builds fine on a headless box, and it can be driven over X forwarding or VNC,
# or built now and used the day the Pi gets a screen. If you want a headless
# receiver instead, that is `sdrpp --server` territory, or SatDump's CLI.

# === PINNED VERSION =========================================================
# Pinned to a dated master commit rather than a tag, deliberately:
#
#   Upstream's only release tag is literally named "nightly" and it moves, so
#   pinning it would pin nothing. The newest numbered tag, 1.0.4, is from
#   2021-10-17 — years behind, predating most of the current source modules, and
#   not a sensible target on a 2026 system.
#
#   So the pin is master at 8c9f5ee (2026-07-05). Reproducible, verified after
#   checkout, and honest about being a snapshot of a rolling project rather than
#   a release. Re-pin by bumping both values together after reading the log.

# OPT_BUILD_SOAPY_SOURCE=OFF: upstream marks the Soapy source deprecated and
# ships it off by default on every platform. Leaving it off also avoids the
# multiple-Soapy-module conflict upstream's own FAQ warns about — RTL-SDR
# reaches SDR++ through its native rtl_sdr_source and librtlsdr instead.
#
# OPT_BUILD_PLUTOSDR_SOURCE=OFF: upstream defaults it ON and it needs libiio,
# which is not in the dependency list above. That is what broke the first image
# build (2026-08-23) — CMake configure failed with "Package 'libiio', required
# by 'virtual:world', not found". The PlutoSDR is an Analog Devices eval board;
# MolniyaOS is an RTL-SDR ground station, so the fix is to stop building a driver
# for hardware the project does not support, not to install libiio and
# libad9361 into every image for a device nobody has. Same reasoning, and the
# same remedy, as the Soapy line above.
#
# ⚠️ The real finding underneath this is worse than one missing package, and is
# NOT fixed here. CMake reported finding libairspy, libairspyhf and libhackrf —
# none of which this script installs. They arrive as transitive dependencies of
# GNU Radio and SatDump, installed by 03a and 03b just before this runs. So
# WHICH SDR++ modules end up in the image is decided by what earlier scripts
# happened to drag in: reorder the stages, or let an upstream bump change
# SatDump's dependencies, and SDR++ silently gains or loses hardware support
# with nothing in the build log flagging it. Making the module set explicit —
# every OPT_BUILD_* named ON or OFF here — is the actual fix. See ROADMAP 4a.
