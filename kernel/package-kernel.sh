# MolniyaOS — package a built kernel for transfer to the Pi
# ============================================================================
# Collects everything the Pi needs into one tarball:
#   - Image                    → goes to /boot/firmware/
#   - modules (.ko files)      → go to /lib/modules/<version>/
#   - dtbs and overlays        → go to /boot/firmware/
#   - System.map               → kernel symbol table (for debugging)
#   - the Pi-side scripts      → so the extracted directory is self-sufficient
#
# On the Pi, install-kernel.sh puts each piece in the right place.
#
# 01-build-kernel.sh runs this as its last step, so normally you never invoke it
# directly. It is a separate script for two reasons: the build script reached the
# 400-line cap and this was the one job in it that is not "build a kernel", and
# repackaging without rebuilding is genuinely useful — change a Pi-side script,
# re-run this, get a fresh tarball in seconds instead of 90 minutes.
#
#   ./package-kernel.sh                    # uses ~/molniya/linux
#   ./package-kernel.sh /path/to/linux     # or an explicit source tree

# Without these the tarball contains only the kernel payload, so the documented
# next step -- extract, then run install-kernel.sh from the extracted directory
# -- has nothing to run, and every script has to be copied over separately.
# They come from two different directories: install-kernel.sh sits beside this
# script in kernel/, while the post-install set lives in userspace/. All are
# flattened into the package root, so the Pi-side layout is unchanged --
# install-kernel.sh still resolves its own directory at runtime and finds boot/
# and modules/ beside it, and 02-post-install.sh finds its job scripts beside it.
#
# 02e is packaged but is NOT in the sequencer. It changes machine policy for
# one deployment shape -- an unattended box on a cheap card -- and the bench
# box must not acquire that policy silently between two benchmark passes. It
# ships because the tarball is how Pi-side scripts arrive, and a hardening
# script that never reaches the Pi hardens nothing.
#
# 02-post-install.sh is a sequencer: without 02a-02d it exits with a diagnostic
# and installs nothing. Dropping one of them here would ship a tarball that looks
# complete and fails on the Pi, so the loop below hard-fails on any missing entry
# rather than warning.
