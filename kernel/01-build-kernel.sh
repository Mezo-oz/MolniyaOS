# MolniyaOS Kernel Build Script for Raspberry Pi 5
# ============================================================================
# Run this inside your Debian ARM64 UTM VM.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   1. Installs build dependencies
#   2. Clones the Raspberry Pi kernel source (their fork, not mainline)
#   3. Starts from the Pi 5's default config (bcm2712_defconfig)
#   4. Merges our SDR/RT customizations on top
#   5. Opens menuconfig so you can review and tweak
#   6. Builds the kernel, modules, and device tree blobs
#   7. Packages everything into a tarball ready to SCP
#
# WHY THE PI KERNEL FORK AND NOT MAINLINE:
#   The Raspberry Pi Foundation maintains their own kernel fork at
#   github.com/raspberrypi/linux. It's based on mainline Linux but includes
#   patches for Pi-specific hardware (VideoCore GPU, PCIe controller, the
#   RP1 I/O chip on Pi 5, etc). Think of it like how Cisco IOS is based on
#   BSD but with Cisco-specific drivers bolted on. You *can* use mainline,
#   but you'd be missing drivers for half the hardware on the board.
#
# WHY bcm2712_defconfig:
#   This is the Pi Foundation's known-good starting config for the Pi 5's
#   BCM2712 SoC. It's like using a vendor's default switch template —
#   everything that the hardware needs is already enabled, and you customize
#   from there instead of guessing what's needed.

# Change these if you want a different kernel branch or build directory
KERNEL_URL="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git"
KERNEL_BRANCH="rpi-6.12.y"       # Latest Pi LTS branch with RT support
BUILD_DIR="$HOME/molniya"         # scratch workspace: kernel source + artifacts
KERNEL_DIR="$BUILD_DIR/linux"        # kernel *source* tree (cloned here)
# The staging directory and the tarball are package-kernel.sh's business; it
# derives both from BUILD_DIR, which is passed to it as MOLNIYA_BUILD_DIR.

# Exact commit to build. Empty means "tip of $KERNEL_BRANCH", which is the
# long-standing behaviour and which means two builds weeks apart are not the same
# kernel. Set it at the v0.25 rebuild and put the same SHA in
# benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md: a published benchmark has to name the kernel it
# measured. Either way the SHA actually built is captured below, printed, and
# shipped in the package as kernel-commit.
KERNEL_COMMIT="f5a99b95354d38db209003a7d00560e5091ba94a"

# There was an OUTPUT_DIR="$BUILD_DIR/output" here. It was never referenced --
# staged files go to PACKAGE_DIR and the finished tarball is written to
# BUILD_DIR, which is what the README documents. Removed rather than wired up:
# introducing an output/ directory now would change the documented artifact path
# for no benefit.

# Number of parallel build jobs — defaults to all cores, override with JOBS=N.
# This is like setting worker threads on a build server.
# More cores = faster build, but also more RAM usage (~1.5GB per job).
# On 4GB RAM use $(nproc); if you get OOM kills or thermal throttling on a
# small box, export JOBS=3 (or 2) before running instead of editing this file,
# so the tree stays clean and pulls don't conflict.
JOBS="${JOBS:-$(nproc)}"

# Gate the build on the options that define this kernel.
#
# merge_config.sh warns about options whose dependencies are unmet and then
# carries on, and menuconfig lets you toggle anything back off by accident. Both
# failure modes are silent: you would spend 45-90 minutes building, install,
# reboot, and only find out at the post-install check that PREEMPT_RT never made
# it in -- at which point the entire point of the kernel is gone and the only
# remedy is to build again.
#
# Called twice: once after the merge (so a dependency problem is diagnosed
# immediately) and once after menuconfig (so the state actually compiled is the
# state verified).
#
# The two Phase 4d symbols are here for a third failure mode, found on
# 2026-08-23: merge_config.sh does not fail on a symbol that does not exist, so
# a misspelled pin in the fragment is not a warning, it is nothing at all. The
# VCIO pin had been misspelled since it was written and the resulting kernel was
# fine anyway, because the Pi defconfig supplies that symbol. A pin whose only
# evidence of working is that the default already agrees with it is not
# protecting anything. Reading the merged .config back is the check the merge
# itself cannot perform.
