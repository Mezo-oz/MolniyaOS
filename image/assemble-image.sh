# MolniyaOS — assemble the A/B image (Phase 4a, stage 3)
# ============================================================================
# Takes stage 2's rootfs and bootfs and writes them into a partitioned image
# built from image/layout.sh. Prints the image path on stdout.
#
#   ./assemble-image.sh                       assemble from the build cache
#   ./assemble-image.sh --kernel <tarball>    also place kernel/DTBs in each bootfs
#   ./assemble-image.sh --out <path>          write somewhere other than the cache
#
# EVERY NUMBER COMES FROM layout.sh. This script contains no partition numbers,
# no sizes and no offsets of its own; it calls `layout.sh sfdisk`, `autoboot`,
# `cmdline`, `fstab`, `slotmap` and `min-bytes` and does as it is told. That is
# the whole reason layout.sh exists, and this is the consumer it was written
# for.
#
# BOTH SLOTS GET THE SAME ROOTFS. A fresh card therefore has a working fallback
# from its very first boot, before any update has ever run. The alternative --
# ship slot B empty and fill it on first update -- means the rollback everyone
# is relying on does not exist until after the first successful update, which
# is exactly the moment it is most likely to be needed.
#
# SAFETY: this writes filesystems, and it does it through a loop device. It
# never takes a block device as a target -- only a file it creates itself -- so
# there is no argument that can point it at a real disk. Mount bookkeeping and
# teardown follow build-rootfs.sh: mount_into() records, an EXIT trap unmounts
# in reverse, and the loop device is always detached.

# Turn the base image's placeholder account into a usable, key-only login.
#
# WITHOUT THIS THE IMAGE BOOTS TO A PROMPT NOBODY CAN ANSWER. Verified in the
# base: `pi` exists at uid 1000 but its password is LOCKED and its shell is
# /usr/sbin/nologin. It is a placeholder that userconfig.service is meant to
# rename at first boot after reading /boot/firmware/userconf.txt. A headless
# appliance shipped without that file therefore has no way in at all -- not by
# console, not by SSH.
#
# Done at build time rather than through userconf.txt because the first-boot
# path depends on service ordering and on files that sshswitch and userconf
# DELETE as they consume them. Provisioning here is deterministic and can be
# inspected in the finished image instead of hoped for on first boot.
#
# Three things that had to be checked rather than assumed, each of which would
# have produced a broken account:
#   - the shell is nologin, so a key alone would not get a session;
#     `usermod -s /bin/bash` is what userconf does and is required here too
#   - the base ships NO /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd, so userconf's sed that
#     patches it is a no-op on Lite. `pi` IS in the sudo group, but the password
#     is locked, so sudo would prompt for a credential that cannot exist. An
#     explicit NOPASSWD drop-in is therefore mandatory, not a convenience.
#   - renaming must be idempotent: stage 3 runs this once per slot, and a second
#     pass finds no `pi` to rename.
