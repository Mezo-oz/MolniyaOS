# MolniyaOS — verify an assembled image (Phase 4a)
# ============================================================================
# Mounts a finished .img read-only and asserts, against layout.sh, that what
# was actually written matches what was meant to be written.
#
#   ./verify-image.sh                  verify the image in the build cache
#   ./verify-image.sh <path.img>       verify a specific image
#   ./verify-image.sh --release <img>  also assert what only a RELEASE must hold
#
# --release exists because one assertion is a defect in a release artifact and
# a correct state in stage 3's output: the stock module trees. Stage 2 leaves
# them because it does not get to depend on stage 3 deleting the stock kernels,
# and stage 4 removes them. Making that a plain check would print FAIL against
# a good stage-3 image, and a check that cries wolf on correct output is how a
# team learns to skim past output.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A CHECKLIST. Stage 3 prints a log full of
# reassuring "==> populating root B" lines and exits 0. Every defect this phase
# has produced so far had that shape: a step that ran, reported success, and
# proved nothing -- a kernel the firmware would never load, a manifest naming
# packages it had not installed, an installer reporting SKIPPED as success. The
# log is the build's own account of itself. This reads the artifact instead.
#
# IT DERIVES NOTHING. Every expected value comes from layout.sh or from the
# image itself; this file hardcodes no offset, no size and no partition number.
# A check that carries its own copy of the answer is a check that agrees with
# itself when layout.sh changes underneath it.
#
# READ-ONLY THROUGHOUT. The loop device is attached with -r and every mount is
# `ro`, so a verification pass cannot be what modifies the thing it is
# verifying -- and it can be run against an image that is about to be flashed
# without invalidating the digest taken beforehand.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT TELL YOU: whether the image BOOTS. Every assertion here is
# structural. A card that passes this can still fail at the firmware, in the
# initramfs, or at the first service. That test needs hardware.
