# MolniyaOS — install the TLE refresh timer
# ============================================================================
# Run this ON THE PI as root:
#
#   sudo bash automation/install-tle-timer.sh
#   sudo bash automation/install-tle-timer.sh --user homelab
#   sudo bash automation/install-tle-timer.sh --no-run
#   sudo bash automation/install-tle-timer.sh --uninstall
#
# WHAT IT CHANGES, exhaustively:
#   installs  /usr/local/lib/molniya-tle/tle-updater.sh
#   installs  /usr/local/lib/molniya-tle/atomic-write.sh  (its helper)
#   links     /usr/local/bin/molniya-tle-update -> the updater above
#   installs  /etc/systemd/system/molniya-tle-update@.service
#   installs  /etc/systemd/system/molniya-tle-update@.timer
#   enables   molniya-tle-update@<user>.timer
#   runs      one update immediately, unless --no-run
#
# Nothing else. --uninstall reverses all of it.
#
# WHICH USER, AND WHY IT IS NOT ROOT:
#   The updater writes ~/.predict/predict.tle and ~/.config/satellite-tle/.
#   Installed as root, it would faithfully maintain elements in /root, where
#   predict — run by a human — would never look at them, and the failure is
#   silent: predict answers from its shipped elements with no indication they
#   are years old. So the timer is enabled on a template instance named for the
#   account that will actually run predict. Default is $SUDO_USER, i.e. whoever
#   typed sudo. --user overrides it.
#
# WHY IT RUNS ONE UPDATE AT INSTALL TIME:
#   Enabling a timer starts the timer, not the service, so without this the
#   first evidence the unit works at all would arrive up to twelve hours later
#   — and a ground station that discovers its element source is broken during a
#   pass has discovered it too late. --no-run skips it for an offline install.
#
# WHY A DIRECTORY AND A SYMLINK, NOT ONE FILE IN /usr/local/bin:
#   The updater calls atomic-write.sh from its own directory. Copied alone into
#   /usr/local/bin it would fetch, validate, back up — and then die at the first
#   write with no helper beside it. Both files keep their repo names in one
#   directory, and the command name the unit runs is a symlink to it.
# ============================================================================

# timer on a boot where it has not fired yet can be absent from that listing,
