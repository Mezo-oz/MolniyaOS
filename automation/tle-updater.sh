# MolniyaOS — TLE updater
# ============================================================================
# Refreshes orbital elements from CelesTrak. Run it before any session, and on a
# timer for an unattended box.
#
# TLEs decay: a set a week old will point an antenna at empty sky. This is the
# closest thing a ground station has to a clock that needs winding.
#
# THE PATH BUG THIS FIXES:
#   02c-sdr-userspace.sh downloads elements to ~/.config/satellite-tle/, which
#   predict never reads. predict reads exactly one file, ~/.predict/predict.tle,
#   so every "predict -p" answer came from whatever elements the curses installer
#   shipped with — silently stale, with nothing to indicate it. This writes the
#   file predict actually opens.
#
# TWO DESTINATIONS, ON PURPOSE:
#   ~/.predict/predict.tle          a small curated set, for predict
#   ~/.config/satellite-tle/*.tle   whole groups, for gpredict / SatDump / scripts
#
#   They are separate because predict tracks a bounded number of satellites (its
#   documentation says 24) and reads them from that one file. Pointing it at the
#   93-satellite amateur group would not give you 93 satellites; it would give
#   you an unpredictable subset. So predict gets an explicit list, by catalogue
#   number, and everything else gets the groups.
#
# WHY CATALOGUE NUMBERS FOR THE PREDICT SET:
#   The obvious group query does not work. GROUP=noaa is not a valid CelesTrak
#   group and answers HTTP 200 with an error string in the body; GROUP=weather is
#   valid but holds no NOAA 15/18/19. The README has both in full. It is also why
#   every download is validated before install: the failure mode here is a 200
#   with prose in it, not an error code.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./tle-updater.sh                 update both destinations
#   ./tle-updater.sh --predict-only  skip the group downloads
#   ./tle-updater.sh --dry-run       fetch and validate, install nothing
#
# ON A TIMER — CelesTrak asks not to be polled hard; twice a day is plenty for
# elements that are published daily:
#
#   crontab -e
#   17 5,17 * * *  /home/pi/MolniyaOS/automation/tle-updater.sh >> /var/log/molniya-tle.log 2>&1
#
# Exits non-zero if any source failed to fetch or failed validation, so a cron
# job or systemd timer reports it rather than leaving stale elements in place.
#
# SIZE: this file runs close to the project's 400-line cap. Read the extraction
# rule in ROADMAP.md before adding to it — lose lines here first, and if that is
# not possible, what comes out must be an executable helper returning data on
# stdout, never a sourced library.

# NOT named GROUPS: bash defines GROUPS itself as an array of the current user's
